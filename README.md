# Simon Says Game (React)

The **Simon Says** game is a memory game where players must repeat sequences of colored lights and sounds. The sequence becomes progressively longer and more challenging as the player successfully repeats each round.

This version of **Simon Says** is built using **React.js**, with CSS for styling and animations.

## Demo

## Features

- **Color Sequences**: The game displays a sequence of colors that the player must repeat.
- **Sound Effects**: Each color is associated with a sound, adding an auditory challenge to the game.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The sequence becomes longer and more challenging as you successfully repeat the pattern.
- **Game Over and Reset**: If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and they can start again.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for managing the game state, rendering the UI, and handling user interactions.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for the game interface, including button hover effects and color transitions.
- **JavaScript**: The core language used to handle the game logic, such as sequence generation, user input handling, and game flow.
- **HTML**: Used to structure the game's UI components and buttons.
- **Audio**: Each color button in the game is associated with a sound effect, enhancing the user experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
